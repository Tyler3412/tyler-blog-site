Hi, this is a quick guide on how to get started in fitness. This guide contains:

## The Quick and Easy Way To Get Started
I'm a huge advocate that fitness is a lifestyle. Not in some weird it has to be your entire personality, but in the way that it's something that pertains to your health at all times. Think of it like treating your physical health. I've met many many people who start on New Years day, and within a week they're gone. It was simply too much for them. Maybe this sounds like you, or you know someone like this. Some people can get away with starting a habit like this, but it's not everyone.

In fact, the vast majority of people hate exercise when they first start. But it's a habit that needs to be built slowly. You wouldn't expect yourself to be able to run a marathon without training, so why do we expect ourselves to make drastic changes to our lives? So here's how I'd start.

I'd pick one thing. One. Not two, three, or however many changes you want to make. Just one thing. Maybe it's walking for 30 minutes a day. Maybe it's waking up an hour earlier. Or going to sleep at the same time every night. Just ensure that it's one change. Stick to it for a few weeks, let it be second nature. Make it a point every day to do these things. Then change one more thing. Slowly build these positive habits in your life first, then we can start training.

Here's a list of things that I'd recommend prioritizing first:
1. Sleeping at a consistent time each night
2. Waking up at a consistent time each morning
3. Drinking 3 liters of water every day
4. Walking for 30 minutes a day
5. Stretching for 10 minutes each night before you sleep. Any 10 minute full body stretching video on Youtube will do
6. Limiting junk by eating food cooked at home, emphasizing whole ingredients.

Once we've worked up to some strong foundational habits, we can begin training. Conveniently, the strength and endurance programs are 3 days each, meaning we can train almost daily, leaving one day for rest. The sessions are relatively brief, lasting about an hour at most for strength and 30 minutes for endurance. This is the last and final habit to build, pat yourself on the back for making it here.
## Training Part 1: Strength Training
I'd recommend checking with a physician if you're unsure of anything here. This isn't medical advice, just my own opinion on how I get beginners started. If you feel sharp pain at any time, please see a physio. With this disclaimer out of the way, let's begin.

For beginners, I love to start with calisthenics. Calisthenics is bodyweight training. No gym necessary, so it's largely accessible. I would recommend finding a pullup bar to use, ideally a park with bars of multiple heights. If this isn't possible, you can still progress initially, but you'll find it hard to progress as you get stronger.

The first thing that I'd do is start here: [Bodyweight Fitness Primer](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/reddit-bwf-primer/). This will give you all of the foundational knowledge you'll need about fitness. It's a 14 day routine which comes with readings that'll explain the basics in bite sized pieces. Once you've completed the primer and can meet the graduation requirements, we can move onto this routine: [Primer Continuation](https://nick-e.com/bwsf/). 

Moving beyond the above routine will be a topic for another post.
## Training Part 2: Endurance
Next we have endurance training. Same disclaimer as above.

Endurance is extremely simple. This section is only going to detail running, or rather jogging. Very slowly at first, and eventually we can work up to a 5 km run. Follow this routine to do that: [Couch to 5k Program](https://c25k.com/c25k_metric/).

Once you're able to complete this routine, I'd recommend doing a 5 km run twice to three times per week. Nothing too insane, and just like the strength section, moving on from this routine is going to be left for another post.
