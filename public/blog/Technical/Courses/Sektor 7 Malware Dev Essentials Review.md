## TLDR
The Sektor7 Malware Dev Essentials course is an introductory course focused on developing basic malware. It's targetted towards pentesters and anyone interested in learning how to write malware for Windows. Overall, I think the course was pretty straightforward and easy to understand. I enjoyed it built upon previous concepts and it felt like everything came together nicely. That being said, get it on Udemy when it's on sale.

## Course Overview
The S7 Malware Essentials course consisted of an introduction, examining portable executable file formats, writing droppers, obfuscating your code, making backdoors and trojans, and lastly the basics of code injections. All of the code is written in C++.

In the PE file section, we look at the internal structure of PE files and examine different headers. We're also provided with an [infographic](https://github.com/corkami/pics/blob/master/binary/pe101/pe101.png) that gives a more in-depth breakdown of different sections. The course goes further into detailing the key differences between compilation of DLL and exe files.

Next, we get to the dropper section. In this section, we learn how to store a payload in different sections of an exe file and learn to execute it. Overall this section was extremely straightforwards so I don't have too much to say about it.

Similarly, the obfuscation section was also very intuitive. If you're familiar with encryption and encoding, this section is a breeze. Essentially we go over how to use encryption and encoding to hide the payload from basic detections. One thing I did enjoy a lot about this section was the addition of function call obfuscation for Windows antivirus evasion.

Moving along, we have the backdoor and trojan section. I think this section could've used a few more examples. We go over a singular example of backdooring putty, which was fine but I think the section would be much more concrete with a few more examples.

Finally, we get to the last main section of the course: code and DLL injection. This section was great. It introduces why we inject code into another process, then walks through how to do so. It does the same thing with DLL. Overall I felt it was well structured and paced.
## Pros and Cons
Let's first get into the pros of this course: I think it's well structured and the way that it builds on concepts to get to a sort of final project was great. You get to see how each of the parts connects to work together. 

Next we have the cons. Honestly there's not much to list. I wish some things went into a bit more depth. I think the course spends a bit too much time on droppers and could've went so much more in depth with backdooring and process injection. 
## Closing Thoughts
Overall, the Sektor 7 intro course is great. It has it's pros and cons, but lays a solid foundation for further learning. It puts together the basics in a nice complete package while showing how each part integrates into a greater system.
