## Intro
WannaCry is a ransomware that hit the world in May of 2017, utilizing EternalBlue to self propogate throughout the world. It would encrypt files, demanding US $300 to $600 in bitcoin to decrypt the files. The initial attack began on May 12th, which was shut down about 7 hours later with the registration of a domain that triggered the program's killswitch. It's estimated that the attack has affected more than 300,000 computers at the time and totaling up to billions in damage. Since then, a secondary variant has been released. For this analysis, we'll be focusing on the original variant.
