Hi, I'm Tyler. This is my desktop space, it represents a collection of what I've been up to and what's currently on my mind.
There's a blog folder below that'll open up to a few topics:
- CTF Writeups
    - I compete with UofT CTF, focusing on forensics challenges. The writeups for the competitions I compete in can be found here
- Non-technical posts
    - This channel is mainly for me to share food and talk about fitness
- Technical posts
    - Just a collection of random things that I find interesting
