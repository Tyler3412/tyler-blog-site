Hi, I'm Tyler. Basic introduction, but I'm known for quite a few things:
- Playing on UofT CTF with a focus on forensics chals
- Being very passionate about learning in general
- Loving fitness and leading a healthy lifestyle

On this site, you'll find a collection of my blog posts writing about various interests. I've separated them between technical, nontechnical, and CTF writeups for easier organization.
